Trying **XState** with **Atomico**

Please refer to the tutorial in **XState** docs: https://xstate.js.org/docs/tutorials/reddit.html which explains how to use XState to manage states in React.

Here we try to use **XState** for state management with Atomico as a web component library.

Also provided the same logics with **RxJS**.

Sample subreddits are an array of
`frontend`, `reactjs`, `rxjs`, `xstate`, `atomico`.

While subreddits `frontend`, `reactjs`, `rxjs` are ok, the `xstate` return empty set, and `atomico` failed.

**Notes:** It was used minmal CSS styling to point out the codes' logics.
