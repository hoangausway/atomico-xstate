Trying **XState** and **RxJS** with **Atomico**

Please refer to the tutorial in **XState** docs: https://xstate.js.org/docs/tutorials/reddit.html which explains how to use XState to manage states in React.

Here we try to use **XState** for state management with Atomico as a web component library.

Also provided the same logics with **RxJS**.

Sample subreddits are an array of `frontend`, `reactjs`, `rxjs`.

**Notes:** It was used minimal CSS styling to focus on the codes' logics.
